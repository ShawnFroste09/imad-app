                Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, individuals who can 
                only survive by eating human flesh, live among the normal humans in secret, 
                hiding their true nature to evade pursuit from the authorities. Including 
                enhanced speed, senses, and regenerative ability, a regular ghoul is several 
                times stronger than a normal human, has a skin resistant to ordinary piercing 
                weapons and has at least one special predatory organ called a "Kagune", which 
                it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of
                ghouls is that when they are excited the color of their sclera in both eyes 
                turns black and their irises red. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the 
                eyes undergoes the transformation. A half-ghoul can either be born naturally as
                a ghoul and a human's offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some 
                ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger
                than a pure-blood ghoul. There is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of 
                ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while 
                possessing enhanced abilities, but shortened lifespans. To hunt down the ghouls
                , several government-sponsored organizations around the world were 
                created.
