                Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated 
                by Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a high school student who 
                discovers a supernatural notebook from a Shinigami named Ryuk that grants its 
                user the ability to kill anyone whose name and face he knows. The series 
                centers around Light's attempts to create and rule a world "cleansed of evil" 
                as "God" using the notebook, and the efforts of a detective known as L to stop 
                him.
